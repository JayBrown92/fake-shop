## Test Questions

> 1. What part of your solution are you most proud of and why?

not really proud of my finished test, but I was able to format my template quickly and render all the products onto the page without any issues, aside from next/image throwing errors.

> 2. What was the most difficult part of this?

I wanted to reload the information on screen based on user input. My plan was to do this via url perameters passed to getServerSideProps, but I ran into bugs and ultimately never got to filter results the way I wanted. Currently results are filtered through rerendering the component with useEffect.

> 3. If you had more time, what would you have done to improve this task?

I should have set up the different pages for each category and focused on them before worrying about sorting the results. That was I would've had a more complete website with navigation links for each category. I spent too much time on one issue and it has cost me progress.

> 4. What would you change about this test to make it better?

The test itself wasn't too bad, so I'm not sure what I would have changed. For me personaly, I should have planned better.
